AI Engineer â€“ GPT Search for Ecommerce


I'm working with one of Stockholm's most exciting and foreward thinking startups, a talented group of engineers & product-people who are looking for a cracked AI/ML engineer to join them as they transform the ecommerce space!


We're building a groundbreaking GPT-powered search experience that transforms traditional ecommerce search bars into intuitive, conversational interfaces. As a senior engineer, youâ€™ll be at the core of this AI-native product, combining semantic search, RAG pipelines, and personalization to redefine how people discover products online.


ðŸ”§ What Youâ€™ll Do


Lead the development of a conversational search product powered by cutting-edge LLM technology.
Design, build, and optimize RAG pipelines, semantic retrieval systems, reranking models, and hyper-personalized search features.
Move fast: prototype rapidly, iterate based on real-world shopper and merchant feedback, and deploy to production.
Own the end-to-end ML lifecycleâ€”from prompt engineering and model fine-tuning to evaluation and latency tuning.
Evaluate model architectures and APIs to balance performance, cost-efficiency, and user delight.
Collaborate cross-functionally with product, engineering, and leadership to craft a unified user experience.
Help scale a multi-tenant AI foundation across diverse brand needs with a mix of automation and customization.
Shape our engineering culture around experimentation, learning, and speed.


ðŸ™Œ Who You Are
You think like a founderâ€”scrappy, hands-on, and comfortable navigating ambiguity.
Youâ€™re energized by LLMs, vector databases, semantic search, and real-world AI applications.
Youâ€™ve built or contributed to production-grade ML systemsâ€”especially in ranking, retrieval, or inference-heavy domains.
You thrive in high-velocity environments where priorities evolve and builders lead the way.
You value impact over process and aren't afraid to hack something together to validate quickly.
Bonus if youâ€™ve worked with ecommerce search, vector DBs (FAISS, Weaviate), LangChain, OpenAI APIs, or similar tools.


ðŸ’¼ Whatâ€™s In It For You
Be a founding engineer of a high-impact product in a new AI category.
High ownership, full autonomy, and real influence on product direction.
Competitive compensation
Hybrid work - Stockholm HQ but with a very flexible model
30 days paid vacation + wellness and learning budgets..
Monthly co-working and quarterly off-site retreats.


This is a permanent role - Visa sponsorship is currently not supported.


Want to help reinvent how people shop onlineâ€”powered by AI? This is your moment.
